# Collect - Illuminate Collections

Written by Taylor Otwell as a part of Laravel's [Illuminate/Support](https://github.com/illuminate/support) package, Collect is just the code from Support needed in order to use Collections on their own.

Lovingly split by [Tighten Co.](http://tighten.co/), with a kick in the butt to finally do it from [https://github.com/assertchris](@assertchris).
